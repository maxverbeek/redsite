# A small guide to this article system

This is the first test article.
These articles support __markdown__! It is extremely easy to create
[links](https://google.com) to anything.

New paragraphs can be created by using a blank line.

#### Titles

A `#` in front of a line will turn it into a title. The more `#`'s you put in front of
the line, the smaller the title will be.

#### Lists

Moreover, it is extremely easy to generate lists, either enumerated:

1. The most important thing in this list.
2. This thing is secondary.
3. I don't really care about this thing
4. At this point I might as well not write stuff down

*.. or unordered:*

- Lists are amazing
- Markdown is pretty cool
