# Creating new articles
It is extremely easy to create new articles. Simply put a file in the `/articles` folder.
To assign a date to an article, write `:date=(yyyy-mm-dd)` on the first line of the file.

The articles will be displayed in reverse alphabetical order. So out of articles starting with
`001-` and `002-`, article `001` will be the oldest, and therefore appear **last** on the website.

Currently there is no easy way to only display `x` articles, so you'll have to remove some yourself
when it gets too cluttered/slow.
