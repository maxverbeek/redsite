                    <h1>About us</h1>
                    <p>The clan was founded in December 2015 by me, The_JokerGirl. Since then we have steadily increased in number, and every active member has noticeably improved. Unfortunately we have lost members overtime, but the three most important members have been in RED since the beginning: Xaracen, souli and skimmet. Have you ever seen RED|MenShooter? No? Maybe you've seen him as RedMenShooter, long before the clan was founded. He was the inspiration for the name of RED|Clan. We use Discord for voicechat, for questions please message me privately (The_JokerGirl#6171) or on our <a href="https://discord.gg/HAnm9xF" target="_blank">info chat on our server</a>.</p>
                    <p>You want to join RED? Recruitment depends on the mutual agreement of the clan leader and above-mentioned most important members. But assuming you're a decent, friendly player willing to train with us then you probably are RED material. Being able to voice chat is really important, and so is activity.</p>
                    <p>We don't only play Sauerbraten, but it sure is the game that most of us play, as it was the game in which we met each other. RED|skimmet and I, RED|JokerGirl for example, like to play GTA V as well. Paladins is another game we sometimes play together and of course, everyone in this clan has their own games that they play.</p>
                    <p>Currently, we have two sauerbraten servers. One of them is our clanserver (RED|Clanserver) and the other is a public eCTF server, called b00blounge. b00blounge because boobs are good.</p>
                    <p>For now, that's all about us. We hope to see you on Sauerbraten some time!</p>

She grew the clan to what it is today, and verbally owns everyone when they disagree with her. She is a complete savage and should be avoided when mad. Also packs a fair punch in duels.

His family is also nice, as can be heard over his microphone about half the time he speaks. We met this guy in Paladins, and isn't very active in Sauerbraten. Yet he will kick your ass if he wants to.</div>
